## Board Games - Sales Strategies (Data Visualization Project)

### Introduction

The dataset used in this project consists of information about board games. The analysis completed in this project will help to determine the sales strategies for the company in their upcoming Winter Season.

EDA and data engineering will be performed in order to better understand and organize the dataset. The most important steps will be described and explained while every question (requested in the Assessment Task) is answered. In addition to it, every question has its conclusion, which explains better the thinking process and the accomplishments of each graph. In other words, the Part 3 of this project, that is related to explaining decisions, will be included in Parts 1 and 2.

Different approaches were used to answer the questions. In other words, every graph used is able to answer the questions; however, different approaches show different relevant information, adding extra information when necessary. The rationale behind this is the intention to keep showing more and more information if the company decides to spend more time analyzing the graph.

Regarding colors and fonts of the graphs used in this CA, I decided not to change some of them because I understood, after plotting the graph, that the visualization was harmonic and understandable. This decision was taken after studying and analyzing the Basic Color Theory and The Color Wheel. When that was not the case, modifications were implemented.

This data visualization project was made using Python and uses popular visualization libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Altair to create a total of 13 different graphs that provide insights into different aspects of the data.


### Data
The data used in this project contains information on over 10,000 board games. The dataset includes data such as the game's name, year of publication, average rating, and number of votes, among others. 


### Visualizations
* Highly detailed graphs: The graphs in this project are highly detailed, providing a comprehensive analysis of the board game sales data.

* Advanced libraries: To create these graphs, advanced libraries such as plotly express, and altair were utilized.

* Visually appealing: The use of advanced libraries ensures that the graphs are visually appealing and easy to understand.

* Informative: Each graph contains a wealth of information that can be used to make informed decisions about sales strategies for the upcoming winter season.


### Libraries Used

* Plotly: Plotly is a web-based data visualization library that allows users to create interactive charts and graphs.

* Altair: Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python that is built on top of Vega-Lite.

* Seaborn: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

* Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### Key words:

* Data visualization project
* Basic Color Theory
* The Color Wheel
* Highly detailed graphs
* Visually appealing
